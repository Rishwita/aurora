dance 
reason
hi ...this is something we all have been looking for to tell our parents why was it important to dance.
well,this is nothing like anything is world ,and when you know you love it ,it is much harder to stay away from it.
people say it is not gonna help you in anyway you'd be almost ruining your future..this is because these peolple think 
dance would be jus givin u a low income job or if you are lucky you may become a choreographer..yeah choreographer is a 
good job but is that it?? no, cause they don't see happiness in your eyes when you dance...people lyk my father say
whats the use of dancing according to him..it is nothing but mere entertainment i donno how many out there agree with him
but for those who do there is some information for you...look,in the earlier days during wars,when people united to 
fight against the foreign forces to save their country.for example nationalism in europe .people tried to spread nationalism through  art and litrature  .there was one category of people who were not educated enough to read and understand why were they supposed to unite and fight .now that was the time people got a language ,a language of movement and expressions ,a lnguage which expressed
all feelings without a word ,it could be easily understood by all and that was the language of dance.nationalism spread ed through europe by this art which included types of folk dances.well,in india also the earliest dance form of north india according to me was 
khathak...but i know how it actually originated ..those days in maharaja's palaces there were male kathak dancers who
performed kathak and depicted the mythological tales.
western dance in my sense is nthng but freedom..there are not many rules in it and evry one knows abt it..you can
make your all new steps and perform it.it is easy yet magical .you can feel your nerves while doing it .it is more
like speaking out to people your own way..you must have known abt the battle thing..obviously its real and not meant
jus for movies .you can feel the heat of it once you enter the arena..this is how it all started in streets..mj sir 
was one who was amzin in this..thre are all so other dancers who nvr learnt dance anywhr but inspired other people
by the way they dance.it is somethin of lyf itself


so you see dance is much much more than what you can imagine it is.
  you can tell this to all those people who thought it was jus for entertainment..
